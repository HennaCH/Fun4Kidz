# Fun4Kidz
Final Java Project 

Fun4Kidz

Fun4Kidz is an application for kids to learn about shapes and colors while having fun.
Fun4kidz allows the user to choose an image among the given ones and assign it to a color.
There is a car, a flower and a butterfly.
This application also allows the user to choose a background color. The background color can be choosen from a color palette or can be customed.

Fun4Kidz was created using JavaFx in the IntelliJ.
It Fun4Kidz has a main class named HelloApplication, a class named AddShape, that contains the shape and color and a class named AddShapeTest used for Unit testing.

During the building of this project, I had quite a few challenges.
I was not able to build an interface. I did not know what it could be used for and what is the purose of an interface.
In addition, even though I have a unit testing class, and some test inside it, I was not sure what test could be built and if the test that I did build are good.
I hope that in the future I am able to implement a good interface a Unit test class that I would know what to test inside it.

The HelloApplication class contains the buttons to display the shapes. It also contains the events to display the shape when a button is pressed on.
There is in the HelloApplication a color palette (color picker) to assign a color to the background. There is also in this class a textfield where the user can write 
their name and receive a greeting when they submit their name.
The AddShape class contains the shape used to create the image that will be displayed when a button is clicked. Each shape has an assigned color, an assigned x,y
position, and an assigned measurement.
The AddShapeTest class contains test that makes sure that each shape in the AddShape class has the same measurement as those in AddShapeTest class.

This is my UML diagram.

If the link still does not work, I have added a file for the UML diagram in the homework submission.
I will also attach screenshots of my application.
